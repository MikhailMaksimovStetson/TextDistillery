Our goal is to simplify readings without drastically changing the message of the author. The raw knowledge laced in the text should become easier to understand with the output of TextDistillery. We let users translate elaborate English writing into prose suitable for an 8th-grade student. Use cases could go beyond academic journals; users can simplify writing form digital books, web pages, PDFs, and many other formats that can be copied into the distiller program. Future versions of the program may include additional features such as using PDFs as direct inputs to the program. We also plan to create a browser extension that provides the functionality of TextDistillery without the need to install it locally.
