Our goal is to simplify readings without drastically varying the message of the author . The raw knowledge laced in the text should go easier to see with the yield of TextDistillery . We let users read detailed English writing into prose suited for an 8 th - grade pupil . Use cases could go beyond donnish diaries ; users can simplify writing form digital books , web pages , PDFs , and many other formats that can be copied into the distiller plan . Next versions of the plan may admit extra features such as using PDFs as direct inputs to the plan . We too plan to make a browser extension that plies the functionality of TextDistillery without the need to instal it locally .
